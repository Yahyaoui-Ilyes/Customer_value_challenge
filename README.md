In this is data challenge, we are asked to to predict the customer lifetime value for each customer. The goal of this task isn’t necessarily to obtain best predictions results,
but to evaluate the reasoned take on a problem. The provided data spans from January 1st 2019 to January 31st 2019 and represents orders on certain products 
and revenues generated by customers.

## Variable description
*__customer_id__*: A unique customer identifier. <br>
*__order_number__*: unique order identifier. <br>
*__order_date__*: date when order was placed. <br>
*__item_quantity_ordered__*: how many items were ordered. <br>
*__revenue__*: order value. <br>
*__cumulative_revenue__*: revenue a customer had accumulated previously. <br>
*__customer_region__*: region where purchase was placed. <br>
*__customer_gender__*: customer gender. <br>
*__device__*: device type. <br>
*__cost_of_living_rank__*: zip code based ranking of costs of living. <br>
*__customer_lifetime_value__*: revenue a customer generated in the next 12 months. <br>

NB  :  <br>
● *__cumulative_revenue__* is only including previous orders (if there were any) <br>
● *__customer_lifetime_value__* is only including orders in the next 12 months <br>
● 10.0 represents the highest value for *__cost_of_living_rank__* <br>

## Tasks
### Part 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Question 1a
Please guide us through an exploratory data analysis, and explain your findings, e.g.,
- What problems do you observe? <br>
- What solutions would you suggest? <br>

#### Question 1b
Based on your analysis, how would you prepare the dataset before training a customer
lifetime value predictor (regression model)? <br>
- Provide the data preparation code <br>
- Please explain all your decisions, and include visualisations and summaries <br>

### Part 2 - Model Interpretation
Please evaluate and interpret the model in the provided Jupyter Notebook. Here are some
hints:
- How would you interpret the results? <br>
- Is the model well chosen and trained? <br>
- Do you agree with the validation? <br>
- Based on your analysis what would you add/change? <br>

####  Question 3 - Modeling 
Based on your analysis and data preparation suggestions from Part 1, train an easy
customer lifetime value predictor (regression model). <br>
Please explain each of your design choices, e.g. processing, model selection, hyper
parameters, and evaluation criteria.

#### Question 4 - Comparing Models
**Question 4a**  <br>
Compare and contrast your model with the provided one. <br>

**Question 4b**  <br>
Describe possible future improvements for your model.
